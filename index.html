            <h2>WHO ARE WE?</h2>
            <p>More like who am I? I am Asif, or as I like to be called, zero362/zero3620 and I make stuff. I make games, application software, YouTube videos, websites, logos you name it. I've made this site to share my experiences with the world and also as a portfolio showcasing my work. This is also a passion project of mine (the website itself) and I got to learn a lot more making this thing. I hope that we can learn more about each other and maybe create something together. You can find my contact info <a href="#contact">here.</a>Explore the site and see for yourself if you like something or maybe join the community <a href="forum.html">forum!</a></p>
